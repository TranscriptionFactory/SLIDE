 we present SLIDE, a novel data-distribution-free approach to analyze high-dimensional multiomic datasets and uncover latent factors that drive the outcome of interest (Fig. 1a). SLIDE makes no assumptions regarding the distribution of the underlying data as it significantly builds on a unique latent-factor regression framework developed by us12,13. It takes into account an extremely large search space of relationships to converge on a very small subset of biologically relevant and actionable latent factors. Critically, SLIDE incorporates both linear and nonlinear relationships, including complex hierarchical structures. It uncovers significant interacting latent factors in diverse contexts that span scales of organization from cellular/molecular phenotypes.





## Installation Procedure
# SLIDE
First install `SLIDE` in Python by running the following code from a  R command terminal:



```library(devtools)```   
```install_github("jishnu-lab/SLIDE")```



## Running the software

For running the software please refer to `vignette` folder. 




## Hardware Requirements
For minimal performance of the ```SLIDE```,  a computer with about 8 GB of RAM is required. For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:

RAM: 16+ GB
CPU: 4+ cores, 3.3+ GHz/core

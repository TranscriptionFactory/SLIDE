# Overview
We will analyze example output found in `SLIDE/test/out/0.01_1_out`

This is the general workflow:

1. Evaluate latent factor performance using `ControlPerformancePlot.png`
2. Look at top features in each latent factor using `plotSigGenes_marginals.png` and `plotSigGenes.png`
3. Look at interactions between latent factors with `plotInteractions.png`
4. Look at gene lists in `SLIDE_LFs.rds` and `gene_list_Z.txt` files

## Evaluate latent factor performance using `ControlPerformancePlot.png`
This plot shows how the significant latent factors perform relative to their knockoff counterparts:

- The red line is the true performance of the significant latent factors (either correlation for continuous response/Y or AUC for binary response/Y).
- The blue density shows the performance of the knockoffs for the stand-alone/marginal latent factors 
- The green density shows the performance of the true marginal latent factors paired with knockoffs for the interaction latent factors

A good model should have:

- performance red line to the right (better performance) than both the blue and green densities - this indicates that there signal in the significant latent factors.
- green density should be slightly higher than blue, since we are using the true marginal latent factors paired with knockoff interaction latent factors - we are trying to evaluate whether the interaction latent factors are meaningful
- blue density has the lowest performance, as knockoffs for our marginal latent factors should not have signal

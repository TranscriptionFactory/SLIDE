This package implements the Knockoff Filter, a powerful and versatile tool
for controlled variable selection with FDR (False Discovery Rate) control.

The procedure is based on the construction of artificial 'knockoff copies'
of the variables present in the given statistical model. Then, it selects
those variables that are clearly better than their corresponding knockoffs,
based on some measure of variable importance.

Examples
--------
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from knockoff import knockoff_filter, create_second_order
>>> n, p = 100, 50
>>> X = np.random.randn(n, p)
>>> beta = np.zeros(p)
>>> beta[:5] = 3.0
>>> y = X @ beta + np.random.randn(n)
>>> result = knockoff_filter(X, y, fdr=0.1)
>>> print(result.selected)
